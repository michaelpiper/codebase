    <span style="font-weight: 400;">A plans to open Treasure Truck Pop-Ups in the park areas of Technicia. Technicia is represented as a grid of M*N blocks. Each block represents either a park area, denoted by 1, or a commercial area, denoted by 0.&nbsp;</span>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjacent blocks with value 1 are considered a contiguous park. Diagonal blocks with value 1 are not considered part of the same contiguity.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon plans to have a Treasure Truck Pop-Up in each contiguous park. <br />
        <br />Write an algorithm to find the number of Treasure Truck Pop-Ups that Amazon can open in the area of Technicia. </span></p><p><strong>Input</strong>
            <br />The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:-<br /> <em>rows</em>,
             an integer representing the number of rows in the grid;<br /> <em>column</em>, 
             an integer representing the number of columns in the grid;<br /> <em>grid</em>, 
             a two-dimensional integer array representing Technicia.<br /> <br /> <strong>Output</strong><br />
             Return an integer representing the number of Treasure Truck Pop-Ups that Amazon can open in the area of Technicia.<br />
             <br /> <strong>Example</strong><br />Input:<br /> <em>rows </em>= 5<br /> 
             <em>column</em> = 4<br /> <em>grid</em> =<br />1 1 0 0<br />0 0 1 0<br />0 0 0 0<br />1 0 1 1<br />1 1 1 1<br /> <br />Output:<br />3<br /> 
             <br />Explanation:<br />The first cluster is the two adjacent 1&#x27;s in row one.<br /> 
             The second cluster is the 1 on row two, which is not adjacent to any other 1&#x27;s (diagonal blocks are not considered part of the same cluster).<br />
              The third cluster is the set of seven adjacent 1&#x27;s in rows four and five.<br />
              The total number of clusters of open areas = 3.</p>
