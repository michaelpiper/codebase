<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Cloudfront serves files in multiple physical locations in order to minimize client latency. Cloudfront can be visualized as a 2D grid of servers. When Amazon wants to host a file on Cloudfront, the file needs to be distributed to all servers. The servers are in the form of a 2D array of 0s and 1s, where the value 0 represents a server that has yet to receive the file and 1 represents a server that already has the file.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon will initially send the file to a handful of (but not all) servers based on expected utilization. A server, upon receiving a file, will then send the file to adjacent servers that don&#x27;t yet have the file. An adjacent server is either on the left, right, above or below a given server. To conserve bandwidth, once a server receives a file, it will wait 1 hour before sending the file to adjacent servers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the 2D array representing the existence of a new file on each server, write an algorithm that will determine the minimum number of hours required to send the file to all the available servers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p><p><strong>Input</strong><br />The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:<br /> <em>rows</em>, an integer representing the number of rows in the grid;<br /> <em>columns</em>, an integer representing the number of columns in the grid;<br /> <em>grid</em>, an integer array representing the current status of its servers. The value 0 represents a server that has yet to receive the file and 1 represents a server that already has the file.<br /> <br /> <strong>Output</strong><br />Return an integer representing&nbsp;the minimum number of hours required to send the file to all the available servers. Return -1 if all the available servers cannot receive the file.<br /><br /> <strong>Note</strong><br />Diagonally placed cells are not considered&nbsp;adjacent.<br /><br /> <strong>Example</strong><br />Input:<br /> <em>rows</em> = 4<br /> <em>columns</em> = 5<br /> <em>grid</em> =<br />[[0, 1, 1, 0, 1],<br />&nbsp;[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],<br />&nbsp;[0, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br />&nbsp;[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]<br /> <br />Output:<br />2<br /> <br />Explanation:<br />At the end of the first hour, the status of the servers :<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />0, 1, 0, 1, 1<br />1, 1, 1, 0, 1<br />at the end of the second hour, the status of the servers :<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br />By the end of two hours, all the servers are up to date.</p>
